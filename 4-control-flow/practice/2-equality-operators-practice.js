// Create two variables, one equal to '10' and the other equal to 10
let x = "10"
let y = 10
// Comparing the two variables, are they strictly equal?
 console.log(x === y)

// Comparing the two variables, are they loosely equal?
console.log (x == y)

// Comparing our two prior variables, in one statement, are they both loosely equal and strictly equal? (Using the && operator)


// Comparing our two prior variables, in one statement, are they either loosely equal or strictly equal? (Using the || operator)


// Check if the variable set to 10 is not loosely equal to 'ten' 


// Create a variable and initilize it to true, check if it is not strictly equal to 'true'
