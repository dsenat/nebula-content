// USE FAKE INFO FOR THE FOLLOWING EXERCISE

// Initialize a variable called creditCardNum, set it equal to a fake credit card string-number
let creditCardNum = "098765432"

// Initialize a variable called last4SS, set it equal to a 4 string-numbers (dont use your real SS last 4!)
let last4SS = "1234"

// Initialize a variable called userId, set it equal to a fake user ID
let userId = "loveday"

// Initialize a variable called password, set it equal to a fake password
let password ="nebula"

// Create two last variables called inputId & inputPass, initially set them as the same values as userId and password
let inputId = "loveday"
let inputPass = "nebula"

// Write a ternary statement that checks if userId is equal to inputId and if password is also equal to inputPass
// If they are the same, log the credit card num and the last4SS
// If not, log 'incorrect username or id'
let info = (userId === inPutId password = inputPass)
